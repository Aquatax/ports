# ports
flashcards to memorise ports for comptia exam
**Some ports may not be on the exam or in the objectives. My goal was to memorise ports that may be needed. This included the ports listed in Windows Firewall, so all those are included.
**Conversely, I know I am missing a bunch of ports from Comptia. This is a personal project I am sharing so I wont add more till I personally have the time to add more or am ready (eg. HTTPS isnt there, but HTTP is). 
**You can easily edit the data in the .csv file using Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets or any text editor

You need Pandas to run the program. Pandas is necessary to open csv files and does not come with python. Open Main.py to see how to install it.
This program works with python 3.10 and later. I cannot confirm it works on previous versions (it most defenitely doesnt work on python 2.x)

Let me know if its broken or if there is some trouble running it.

If you see the terminal when you run the program, you may notice a countdown. This shows the number of questions you have left. At the end it will tell you how many cards you used to run it along with an average. 

When you press the green Check it removes the card from the pile and you wont get it again. If you click the X the card will stay in the pile and will be seen again at some point.
